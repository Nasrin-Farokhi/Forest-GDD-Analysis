# Forest Productivity and Budburst Phenology: Statistical and Spatial Analysis Using R

This repository contains a comprehensive scientific project in the field of environmental and ecological data analysis. The objective of this work is to investigate forest productivity and predict budburst timing in temperate tree species using climatic and ecological datasets. The entire analysis is implemented in the R programming language, utilising a variety of specialised packages for statistical modelling, geospatial analysis, and data visualisation. We organised the project into three main components:

## üîç Summary of Analyses

### 1. Comparative Analysis of Forest Productivity (ANPP)

To assess the impact of forest management on productivity, we compared log-transformed values of Annual Net Primary Production (ANPP) between managed and unmanaged forest sites. We used a non-parametric Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test to evaluate differences between groups, considering the non-normal distribution of the data.

### 2. Spatial Visualization of European Forest Sites

Using georeferenced data and geospatial tools such as `sf` and `rnaturalearth`, forest sites across Europe were mapped. Each site was categorised by management type, enabling a visual assessment of the spatial distribution of managed and natural forest ecosystems.

### 3. Budburst Modeling Based on Growing Degree Days (GDD)

To model tree budburst timing, the concept of **Growing Degree Days (GDD)** was applied. The GDD required for the budburst in 2018 was calculated based on daily temperature data and then used to estimate the expected budburst date in 2019. This approach provides insight into interannual climatic variability and its influence on phenological responses.

## üìå Project Information

This project was independently developed as an analytical exercise, focusing on the analysis and interpretation of existing ecological datasets. Researchers obtained the data from external sources, and the work aimed to enhance practical skills in ecological data analysis, spatial visualization, and phenological modelling using R.
